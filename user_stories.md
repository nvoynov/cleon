# 1

As a dev, I want to hold my code "clean" and "user-oriented", so it will be easy to write, read, and evolve in the future.

To achieve this I'm going to design my code according to The Clean Architecture principles. At the core level, I'm going to have just three concepts - services (algorithms, use cases, interactors), entities (data structures), and abstract gateways.

# 2

As a dev, I want to turn my code into a "clean" just by copying the basic abstractions (services, entities, and gateway) into my code, so I'll have the ability to customize those to suit my needs.

Maybe there is no need to have the "gateway", or the "repository" is more suitable.

# 3

As a dev, I want to have a basic tool that will help me with boring tasks, like creating the basic code skeleton, creating and requiring source files, so it'll eliminate distraction on right code structuring.
